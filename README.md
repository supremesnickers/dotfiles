# dotfiles
Well hello. This is my collection of Doom Emacs, tmux, vim and zsh configuration files.

The dotfiles are managed using [Stow](https://www.gnu.org/software/stow/). Just install with your favorite package manager.
```bash
brew install stow
```
Them clone this repo and type
```bash
cd dotfiles
stow *
```
